# Simple python FTP uploader

This project implements a simple python script that monitors a folder and, in case of changes, uploads the changed file on an FTP folder.
It works also with **Windows XP** with **Python 2.7** (the reason why I created it ...).

This script was made starting from the code published in the following forums:
